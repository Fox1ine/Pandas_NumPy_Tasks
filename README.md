#  Pandas and NumPy just solving tasks

This project contains solutions to various data analysis tasks using **Pandas** and **NumPy**. The goal is to explore datasets and solve specific problems, focusing on practical applications of these libraries.

## Project Structure

The repository includes the following files:

- `adult.data.csv`: A dataset used for solving tasks related to adult income data. This dataset is analyzed using Pandas to explore different attributes like age, occupation, and education.
- `cereal.csv`: Another dataset containing information about different cereal brands and their nutritional values. This file is used for further Pandas exercises, focusing on data manipulation and analysis.
- `assignment_numpy.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook containing exercises and solutions for working with **NumPy**. It covers tasks such as array manipulation, mathematical operations, and matrix calculations.
- `assignment_pandas.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook with exercises on **Pandas**. It focuses on loading data, filtering, grouping, and applying different transformations to explore the datasets.
